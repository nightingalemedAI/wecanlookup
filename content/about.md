Dr Alistair Quinn - Psychiatry trainee. Harvard computational biology.

Obsessed with recursive self-improvement - in code, in consciousness, and in civilisation.

Major tectonic shifts are underway. AI is reshaping reality, legacy institutions are following outdated scripts, and the gap between emerging capabilities and the structures built to contain them is widening by the day.

We can face this clearly. We can work together. We can look up.

I write about biological and artificial neural networks - and the ways they interact. Essays on statistics. Systems thinking. Health. Human performance. Psychiatry through the lens of predictive coding. Ethics and reasoning under uncertainty. Meaning making and reality selection.

Dr John Lilly called it << metaprogramming >> - rewriting our own cognitive software.

Welcome to the strange loop. Get with the [meta]program.
